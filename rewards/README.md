rewards
=======

This is an example for run jBPM 6 in j2se environment. It was created by forking the rewards-basic application by Toshiya Kobayashi:
https://github.com/tkobayas/jbpm5example/tree/master/rewards-basic


This simple example aims to provide an example usage of:
- Human tasks
- Persistence
- Maven

This application uses single session. Other session strategies (session managers) can be demonstrated later. So far the example supports only dependencies from jBPM 6 as community project.


### Steps to run
- Make sure you have at least Java 6 and Maven 3 installed
- Import project to IDE(eclipse)
- Run `org.jbpm.demo.rewards.ProcessMain` as Java Application
